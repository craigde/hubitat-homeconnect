Update (December 2025):
I forked from Rangner Ferraz Guimaraes (rferrazguimaraes) original driver and rewrote the oauth code due to a race / refresh condition. 

# Hubitat-HomeConnect
Integration for Home Connect appliances [Bosch, Siemens, Neff, Balay, Constructa, Pitsos, Profilo, Thermador and Gaggenau] for Hubitat 

# What can I do with this driver?
Here is a list of currently supported appliances (not all appliances are fully supported):

CoffeeMaker<br>
Dishwasher<br>
Dryer<br>
FridgeFreezer<br>
Hob<br>
Hood<br>
Oven<br>
Washer<br>
WasherDryer<br>

# Installation
Not yet added to "Hubitat Package Manager". Can do this if there is suffcient interest. 

# Note
Amateur coder so use it at your own risk. Some of the features are not yet supported (I just own the dishwasher so I can't really test it on other appliances). If other developers are willing to add better support for the other appliances, just send me a pull request :)

# Credits
This was all possible due to the initial work done by https://github.com/rfg81/hubitat-homeconnect to build the original app and driver.
